# Solidity-Project Smart Contracts

Welcome to the Solidity Smart Contracts repository! This repository contains a collection of simple smart contracts, including the MyToken contract, which is an implementation of a basic token contract using the ERC20 standard.

## Contracts Hereby

### MyToken

- *Contract Name*: MyToken
- *Version*: 1.0.0
- *License*: UNLICENSED
- *Solidity Version*: 0.8.18

#### Project Description

The MyToken contract is a basic ERC20-compatible token contract that allows for minting and burning tokens. It includes the following features:

- Minting: New tokens can be minted and added to the total supply.
- Burning: Tokens can be burned (destroyed) to reduce the total supply.
- Balance Tracking: The contract tracks token balances for different addresses.

#### Usage of Contract

To deploy the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the MyToken.sol file in a Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix).
3. Compile the contract using Solidity version 0.8.18 or a compatible version.
4. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.

Interact with the MyToken contract using the following functions:

- mint(address _address, uint _value): Mint new tokens and assign them to the specified address.
- burn(address _address, uint _value): Burn (destroy) tokens from the specified address if the balance is sufficient.

For more information, refer to the code and comments within the MyToken.sol file.
